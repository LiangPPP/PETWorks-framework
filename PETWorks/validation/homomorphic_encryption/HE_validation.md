# Testing Method for Homomorphic Encryption Technology

The testing criteria for the "Homomorphic Encryption Technology Testing Method" provide the basis for service providers to adhere to. The testing criteria ensure that service providers meet user requirements while simultaneously ensuring the security of data. This includes data protection scope, defining security levels, key protection, and more. When the services provided by a service provider conform to these testing criteria, it signifies that users can trust that their data is protected by homomorphic encryption technology, and the service provider utilizes all necessary functions.

1. The service provider must clearly define the scope of data protection.
2. The service provider should define security levels and disclose the corresponding encryption strength coefficients.
3. Setting security levels by the service provider requires user consent.
4. User-side keys must be protected using encryption functions that comply with FIPS 140-2 Annex A, with a security level of AES-128 or higher.
5. The service provider should provide software upgrade programs and address encryption format conversion issues arising from upgrades.
6. Communication between client-side and server-side programs must be protected using security protocols of TLS1 or higher.
7. The service provider must not embed keys in the source code.
8. The service provider should utilize all necessary functions for encryption.
9. The service provider should accept functional verification by users.
