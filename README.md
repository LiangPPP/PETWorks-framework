# PETWorks-framework

A framework for validating PET enhanced data.

Data Privacy is the keystone promoting stronger and deeper analysis of problem in our society. PET (Privacy Enhancing Tool) is a great helper for making all these happened. However, a trust-worthy and easy-to-use validation tool for PET is still rare. 

Here we provide a framework dealing with the validation problem of PET enhanced data.

### Showcase
Validation of data processed with federated learning.

```python
from PETWorks import dataRecover, PETValidation, report

gradient = "/home/Doc/gradient"
model = "/home/Doc/model"
originalData = "/home/Doc/o.png"

recoveredData = dataProcess(model, gradient, "FL", "recover")
result = PETValidation(recoveredData, originalData, "FL")
report(result, "web")
```

### How it works?
| Module                    | Description                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PET Enhanced Data Process | This module aims to load and process (e.g. recover) PET-enhanced data accordingly to the data and the PET it used.                    |                                                                                                                                       |
| PET Validation            | This module has validation methodologies built in. Returning the result of the validation.                                            |
| Report                    | This module handles the output format of the report.  It could be text-based on the terminal or GUI-based showing on the web browser. |
